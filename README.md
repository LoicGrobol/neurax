Neurax
======

An ssh/sshfs wrapper to improve your mind control over remote machines.

- Establishes an [ssh multiplexed connexion](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing)
- Uses it to mount remote directories of your choice in local path of your choices so you can access them as if there were on your machine
- Open as many shells as you want
- And more! Coming soon! I swear! Hopefully!

## Installation

You will need `ssh` (OpenSSH >3.9 works, I have not tested anything else yet) and `sshfs` installed and in your path to use Neurax, install them anyway you want. Then install Neurax. Vanilla pip should work but I recommend [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/)

```console
pipx install neurax
```
